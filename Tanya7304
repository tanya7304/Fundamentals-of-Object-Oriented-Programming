Task-1:

Suppose you are working on a geometry library that deals with different types of geometric shapes, including circles, rectangles, and triangles. 
Each shape has common properties like area and perimeter, but also specific attributes such as radius for circles, length and width for rectangles, and side lengths for triangles.

•	Develop a class hierarchy for geometric shapes using inheritance in C++.
•	Explain how you would utilize inheritance and polymorphism to implement algorithms for calculating area and perimeter that are specific to each type of shape


Task-2:

An operator overloading allows custom behavior to be defined for built-in operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), when we used with user-defined types.
When overloading binary operators as friend functions, external functions can access private members of a class.
Provide examples how binary operator overloading is implemented using friend functions.
